        - Filter out unwanted stack frames and attributes in the
          $SIG{__DIE__} handler instead of finalize_error().
        - Avoid stringifying refs in the trace, since we now throw them
          away immediately.

        - Allow enabling functionality by config variable

        - actually, the $@ reset is fairly general - need to die($error)
          no matter what.

0.06    2006-07-25 11:52:15
        - fixed bug where $@ would get reset for exception objects
        - changed stylesheets to match Catalyst 5.7000

0.05    2006-07-13 16:34:11
        - fixed bug where an exception in the $SIG{__DIE__} handler would cause
          the original exception to be lost
        - increased contrast on error line (Christopher H. Laco)
        - added reverse option (Christopher H. Laco)

0.04    2006-03-26 22:30:00
        - Properly handle the case where finalize_error is called but there
          is no stacktrace.  This happens if the user manually sets $c->error.

0.03    2006-03-16 23:40:00
        - Made the stack trace fill the entire width.
        - Added respect_overload option for Devel::StackTrace (Stephen
          Steneker)

        - Changed _stacktrace from class data to accessor.
        - Fixed test 4 in 04trace to handle different error messages
          from different Perl versions.
